Welcome to Comp90024 Cluster and Cloud Computing project 2 repository of group 5.

The main objective of this project is to design and implement a cloud-based system that could be deployed on the UniMelb Research Cloud. The system utilized data from Twitter and Mastodon to explore and analyze various intriguing scenarios related to Australia. Additionally, we aimed to compare the results derived from social media data with official data obtained from platforms like SUDO to gain a better understanding of life in Australia.
